SSQP and its `ssqpy` Python module statically link or include code from the
following projects. Their licenses are reproduced below.

Boost is taken from the system when its static libraries are usable,
otherwise version 1.86.0 is fetched (see `SSQP_BOOST_VERSION`). Eigen is a
header-only library taken from the system; its source is available at
https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen. Tracy's client code is only compiled when
`SSQP_ENABLE_PROFILING` is on; the libraries it bundles carry their own notices in
`external/tracy/public`.
